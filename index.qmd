### Learning journey

My journey into programming felt like starring in a drama-comedy series\
- nervously stared at the code like it was ancient hieroglyphs\
- hours of debugging only to realize I missed a semicolon/indentation\
- the code worked (or so I thought).\
- proudly watching my quarto run smoothly… until the next bug sneaked in
