## 1. A Layered Grammar of Graphics: ggplot2 methods

### 1.1 Learning Outcome

In this chapter, we will learn the basic principles and key components of ggplot2. we will get hands-on experience using these components to create statistical graphics based on the principles of the Layered Grammar of Graphics. By the end, we will be able to apply ggplot2's essential graphical elements to create elegant and functional statistical visualizations.

### 1.2 Getting started

#### 1.2.1 Installing and loading the required libraries

The code chunk below uses p_load() from the pacman package to check if the tidyverse packages are installed on my computer. If they are, they will be loaded into the R environment.If not, we will proceed to install pacman first.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

#### 1.2.2 Importing data

We will import *exam_data.csv* into R environment by using the `read.csv()`function and assign it to exam_data

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

We will check the dataset using below

-   `glimpse()`: provides a transposed overview of a dataset, showing variables and their types in a concise format.
-   `head()`: displays the first few rows of a dataset (default is 6 rows) to give a quick preview of the data.
-   `summary()`: generates a statistical summary of each variable, including measures like mean, median, and range for numeric data.
-   `duplicated()`:Returns a logical vector indicating which elements or rows in a vector or data frame are duplicates.
-   `colSums(is.na())`: Counts the number of missing values (NA) in each column of the data frame.

::: panel-tabset
## glimpse()

```{r}

```

## duplicated()

```{r}
exam_data[duplicated(exam_data),]
```

## colSum(is.na(*dataset*))

```{r}

### 1.3 Introducing ggplot

ggplot2 is an R package for creating data-driven graphics based on The Grammar of Graphics. It is also part of the tidyverse family specially designed for visual exploration and communication.

For more information, visit [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

#### 1.3.1 R Graphics VS ggplot

Lets compare how R Graphics, the core graphical functions of Base R and ggplot plot a simple histogram.

::: panel-tabset
## R Graphics

```{r}
hist(exam_data$MATHS,col = "#4169e1")
```

## ggplot2

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="black", 
                 fill="#4169e1") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```

## Reflection

-   While R Graphics offers simpler syntax, [Hadley Wickham](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach_ggplot2_to_beginners/#comment-1745406157) emphasizes that the true value of ggplot2 lies not in its specific plotting syntax, but in the transformative way it approaches visualization. It enables users to think of visualizations as a method of mapping variables to the visual attributes of geometric objects, creating a powerful framework for understanding and perceiving data.
:::

### 1.4 Grammar of Graphics

The Grammar of Graphics, introduced by Leland Wilkinson in 1999, provides a structured approach to creating meaningful data visualizations. It breaks graphs into semantic components like scales and layers, offering a framework to answer the question: What is a statistical graphic?

The key principles Iâ€™ve learned are:

-   Graphics are built from distinct layers of grammatical elements.

-   Meaningful plots are achieved through aesthetic mapping.

This grammar helps me see how complex graphics are composed, uncover connections between seemingly different visuals, and understand the foundation of diverse visualizations. It also guides me toward recognizing well-formed, meaningful graphics while acknowledging that not all grammatically correct visuals will make sense.

#### 1.4.1 A layered grammar of graphics

Figure shows the seven grammars of ggplot2: [A layered grammar of graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html)

![A layered grammar of graphics](/images/Pic06.jpg){width="501"}

The building blocks of the Grammar of Graphics are:

-   **Data:** The dataset being visualized.
-   **Aesthetics:** Attributes like position, color, size, shape, or transparency that map data to visual elements.
-   **Geometries:** Visual elements representing data, such as points, bars, or lines.
-   **Facets:** Subsets of data used to create multiple variations of a graph (e.g., panels).
-   **Statistics:** Transformations summarizing data, such as means or confidence intervals.
-   **Coordinate Systems:** The plane where data is plotted (e.g., Cartesian or polar).
-   **Themes:** Non-data components like titles, axis labels, or legend formatting.

### 1.5 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: data

Let us call the `ggplot( )` function using the code chunk below.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data)
```

::: callout-note
-   A blank canvas is created with `ggplot()`.
-   `ggplot()` initializes a ggplot object.
-   The data argument specifies the dataset for plotting.
-   If the dataset is not already a data.frame, it will be converted to one by fortify().
:::

### 1.6 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: [aesthetic mappings](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html)

Aesthetic mappings link data attributes to visual characteristics like position, color, size, shape, or transparency, allowing each characteristic to represent information. These mappings are defined using the `aes()` function, and each geom layer can have its own `aes()` specification.

The code below adds the aesthetic element into the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x=MATHS,
           y=ENGLISH))
```

::: callout-note
-   ggplot includes the x/y axis and the axis's label
:::

### 1.7 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: geom

Geometric objects are the visual marks on a plot. A layer combines data, aesthetic mappings, a geometric object (geom), statistical transformations (stat), and position adjustments. Layers are typically created using geom\_ functions, with options to override default stat or position settings. **Every plot requires at least one geom**, and additional geoms can be added using the + operator.

Refer [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layer-geoms) for a more comprehensive list.

Below are some examples of `geom_`:

-   **geom_point:** for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)
-   **geom_line:** for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)
-   **geom_col:** for drawing bars with heights mapped to values in the data (e.g., bar charts).
-   **geom_boxplot:** for drawing box-and-whisker plots to visualize data distribution and outliers.
-   **geom_histogram:** for drawing binned values to represent the distribution of a numeric variable (e.g., histograms).
-   **geom_density:** for drawing smoothed density estimates to visualize the distribution of a numeric variable.

![](/images/Pic07.jpg){width="488"}

#### 1.7.1 Geometric objects: [geom_bar]{style="color:#6A5ACD;font-weight:bold;"}

The code below plots a bar chart by using `geom_bar()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x=RACE)) +
  geom_bar()
```

#### 1.7.2 Geometric objects: [geom_dotplot]{style="color:#6A5ACD;font-weight:bold;"}

In a dot plot, the dot width represents the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning method), and dots are stacked, with each dot signifying one observation.

The code below plots a dot plot chart by using `geom_dotplot()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)
```

::: callout-warning
To note that the y scale is not very useful, and can be misleading in this case.
:::

To enhance the dotplot visualization, the below *(non exhaustive)* are some arguments that has been added:

-   `scale_y_continuous()`- to turn off the y-axis by setting it to NULL
-   **binwidth** - specifies the width of the bins or interval used to group the data to - 3.0
-   **dotsize** - adjusts the size of the dots in the plot to - 0.8
-   **fill** - specifies the fill color of the dots to - red
-   **color** - specifies the outline color of the dots to - yellow
-   **alpha** - specifies the transparency level of the dots to - 0.5

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth=3.0,         
               dotsize = 0.8,
               fill="#E15841",
               color="#E1B941",
               alpha=0.5 ) +      
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           
                     breaks = NULL)  
```

#### 1.7.3 Geometric objects: [geom_histogram]{style="color:#6A5ACD;font-weight:bold;"}

`geom_histogram()`in ggplot creates a bar plot that displays the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing the data into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin.

The code below plots a simple histogram by using values in *MATHS* field of exam_data.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram()  
```

::: callout-note
The default number of bins is 30, however one can always adjust the number of bins manually by using the `bins()` argument.
:::

#### 1.7.4 Modifying a geometric object by changing [geom()]{style="color:#6A5ACD;font-weight:bold;"}

To enhance the histogram visualization, the below *(non exhaustive)* are some arguments that has been added:

-   **bins** - to change the number of bins to - 20
-   **fill** - specifies the fill color of the histogram to - red
-   **color** - specifies the outline color of the histogram to - green

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20,            
                 color="#A8E141",      
                 fill="#E15841")
```

#### 1.7.5 Modifying a geometric object by changing [aes()]{style="color:#6A5ACD;font-weight:bold;"}

The code below changes the interior colour of the histogram (i.e. fill) by using a sub-group of aes().

In this case, the fill is based on GENDER.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           fill = GENDER)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="grey30")
```

We can also specify the color of the fill based on GENDER.

In this case, we used the `scale_fill_manual()` function to assign specific colors to each gender. E.g.:

-   <p><strong>[Pink</strong>]{style="color: pink;"} for Female</p>

-   <p><strong>[Blue</strong>]{style="color: blue;"} for Male</p>

-   while keeping the outline [<strong>grey</strong>]{style="color: grey;"}

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS, 
           fill = GENDER)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, 
                 color = "grey30") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Female" = "pink", "Male" = "blue"))

```

::: callout-note
This approach can be used to color, fill and alpha of the geometric.
:::

#### 1.7.6 Geometric objects: [geom_density]{style="color:#6A5ACD;font-weight:bold;"}

The [`geom_density()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_density.html) function computes and visualizes a [kernel density estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation), which provides a smooth approximation of the data's distribution.

It serves as a useful alternative to histograms for continuous data, particularly when the data originates from an underlying smooth distribution.

The code below plots the distribution of Maths scores in a kernel density plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_density()
```

The code below plots two kernel density lines by using *color* or *fill* arguments of `aes()`

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS, 
           colour = GENDER)) +
  geom_density()
```

Likewise, by using `scale_color_manual()` function, we can map the colors of each gender explicitly, where

-   <p><strong>[Pink</strong>]{style="color: pink;"} for Female</p>

-   <p><strong>[Blue</strong>]{style="color: blue;"} for Male</p>

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS, 
           colour = GENDER)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Female" = "pink", "Male" = "blue"))

```

#### 1.7.7 Geometric objects: [geom_boxplot]{style="color:#6A5ACD;font-weight:bold;"}

`geom_boxplot()` function visualizes continuous data by displaying five key summary statistics: the median, the upper and lower hinges (quartiles), the whiskers, and individual outliers.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS,       
           x= GENDER)) +    
  geom_boxplot()    
```

To enhance the boxplot visualization, the below *(non exhaustive)* are some arguments that has been added:

-   **fill** - fills the boxplot with different colors based on a grouping variable - purple
-   **color** - specifies the color of the boxplot borders to - green
-   **outlier.color** - specifies the outlier color of the boxplot to - red
-   **outlier.shape** - specifies the shape of the outlier points to - 16
-   **alpha** - adjust the transparency of the boxplot fill - 0.7
-   **width** - adjusts the width of the boxplots to - 0.7

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS,       
           x = GENDER)) +    
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#6A5ACD",      # Fills the boxes with a color
               color = "#ABE141",     # Sets the border color of the boxes
               outlier.color = "red",  # Colors the outliers
               outlier.shape = 16,     # Sets the shape of the outliers
               alpha = 0.7,            # Adjusts the transparency of the boxes
               width = 0.7)            # Sets the width of the boxes

```

Likewise, to specify different fill colors for female and male, we need to map the fill aesthetic to the Gender variable inside `aes()` and then define the specifc colors using `scale_fill_manual()`.

-   <p><strong>[Pink</strong>]{style="color: pink;"} for Female</p>

-   <p><strong>[Blue</strong>]{style="color: blue;"} for Male</p>

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS,       
           x = GENDER, 
           fill = GENDER)) +   # Map fill aesthetic to GENDER
  geom_boxplot(color = "#ABE141",      # Sets the border color of the boxes
               outlier.color = "red",  # Colors the outliers
               outlier.shape = 16,     # Sets the shape of the outliers
               alpha = 0.7,            # Adjusts the transparency of the boxes
               width = 0.7) +          # Sets the width of the boxes
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Female" = "pink", "Male" = "blue"))  # Custom colors
```

[Notches](https://sites.google.com/site/davidsstatistics/davids-statistics) in box plots help visually determine if the medians of distributions differ. Non-overlapping notches indicate distinct medians.

The code below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, 
           x= GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```

Likewise, additional arguments can be added to improve the overall visualization of the notched plot

-   **fill** - fills the notched plot with different colors based on a grouping variable
-   **color** - specifies the color of the notched plot borders to - black
-   **outlier.color** - specifies the outlier color of the boxplot to - red
-   **outlier.shape** - specifies the shape of the outlier points to - 8
-   **alpha** - adjust the transparency of the boxplot fill - 0.9
-   **notchwidth** - adjusts the width of the notches for improved clarity - 0.5

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, 
           x = GENDER, 
           fill = GENDER)) +  # Add fill to differentiate genders
  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE, 
               outlier.colour = "red",   # Highlight outliers in red
               outlier.shape = 8,       # Use a different shape for outliers
               notchwidth = 0.5,        # Adjust the notch width for emphasis
               color = "black",
               alpha = 0.9) +      
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Female" = "pink", "Male" = "blue"))
```

:::

#### 1.7.8 Geometric objects: [geom_violin]{style="color:#6A5ACD;font-weight:bold;"}

[geom_violin](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_violin.html) creates violin plots, which are useful for comparing multiple data distributions. Unlike density curves, which can overlap and become hard to interpret, violin plots place distributions side by side, making comparisons clearer and more visually accessible.

The code below plots the distribution of Maths score by gender using violin plots.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, 
           x= GENDER)) +
  geom_violin()
```

Likewise, additional arguments can be added to improve the overall visualization of the violin plot

-   **fill** - maps the violin fill color to gender
-   `scale_fill_manual()` - assigns custom colors for Female and Male
-   **trim** - ensures the plot displayes the full range of data, even for smaller distributions
-   **color** - adds an outline to make the violins visually distinct

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, 
           x = GENDER, 
           fill = GENDER)) +  # Map fill to GENDER
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE,   # Show the full range of the data
              scale = "width", # Adjust width for comparability
              color = "black") +  # Add a black outline to the violins
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Female" = "pink", 
                               "Male" = "blue"))
```

#### 1.7.9 Geometric objects: [geom_point]{style="color:#6A5ACD;font-weight:bold;"}

`geom_point()` is useful for creating scatterplot.

The code below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using `geom_point()`

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() 
```

Likewise, additional arguments can be added to improve the overall visualization of the scatter plot

-   **color** - set all points to a fixed blue color
-   **size** - set the size of the points to a fixed value (adjustable) to - 3
-   **alpha** - adds transparency to reduce overlap if points are cluttered
-   **shape** - set the apperance of the points in the scatter plot (e.g.: square, circle, triangle)

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS, 
           y = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3, alpha = 0.5, shape = 20)
```

#### 1.7.10 Combining geometric objects

The code below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_point()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, 
           x= GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot() +

### 1.8 Essential grammatical elements in ggplot2: stat

The [Statistics functions](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#stats) statistically transforms data, as a form of summary.

Example include: - calculating the frequency of variable values - calculating the mean - determing confidence limits

There are two ways to use these functions: - add a `stat_()` function and override the default geom, or - add a `geom_()` function and override the default stat.

#### 1.8.1 Working with [stat()]{style="color:#6A5ACD;font-weight:bold;"}

The boxplots below are incomplete because the means are not shown.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

#### 1.8.2 Working with [stat_summary()]{style="color:#6A5ACD;font-weight:bold;"}

The code below uses the `stat_summary()` function to add mean values by replacing the default geometric layer (geom).

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(geom = "point",       
               fun = "mean",         
               colour ="blue",        
               size=4) 
```

#### 1.8.3 Working with [geom()]{style="color:#6A5ACD;font-weight:bold;"} method

The code below uses the `geom()` function to add mean values by replacing the default geometric layer (geom).

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(stat="summary",        
             fun="mean",           
             colour="blue",          
             size=4)          

```

::: callout-tip
## Reflection

-   Both codes achieve the same result - boxplot with mean values as blue points overlaid on the plot
-   The first code uses `stat_summary` explicitly where summary is calculated `fun = "mean"`, and then visualized using the geometry `geom="point"`. It provides more flexibility if one want to switch the geometry.
-   The second code uses `geom_point` with `stat="summary"`, where it computes the mean and plots it directly.
-   Overall, I would prefer the second code as it feel more intuitive and focuses on using a geometry `geom_point` and overridding its default statistical transformation.
:::

#### 1.8.4 Adding a best fit curve on a scatterplot?

The scatterplot below illustrates the relationship between Maths and English grades.

Adding a best-fit curve can enhance its interpretability.

```{r}
echo=FALSE
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() 
```

`geom_smooth()` is used to plot a best fit curve on the scatterplot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(size=0.5)
```

::: callout-note
The default method used is *LOESS - Locally Estimted Scatterplot Smoothing* which refers to a regression method used for smoothing data points in a scatterplot, useful for capturing non-linear trends in the data.
:::

The default method can be overriden as shown below:

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              linewidth=0.5)
```

::: callout-note
In this case, `method = "lm"` specifies that a linear regression line should be fitted to the data.

Refer [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html) for more information on the different methods available in `geom_smooth()`.
:::

Likewise, additional arguments can be added to improve the overall visualization of the scatter plot

-   **color** - sets the color of the regression line
-   **size** - adjusts the thickness of the line

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS, y = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", size = 1)
```

### 1.9 Essential grammatical elements in ggplot2: Facets

Facetting in `ggplot2` creates small multiples, or trellis plots, to display different subsets of data. This approach is an alternative to using aesthetics (such as color or shape) for displaying additional variables. There are two main types of faceting in `ggplot2`:

-   `facet_wrap()` : wraps multiple plots into a single panel, typically based on a single categorical variable. It will automatically arranges the plots into a grid.

-   `facet_grid()` : organizes plots into a grid based on the values of two categorical variables, one for rows and the other for columns.

#### 1.9.1 Working with [facet_wrap()]{style="color:#6A5ACD;font-weight:bold;"}

[facet_wrap](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html) arranges a 1D sequence of panels into a 2D layout, making better use of screen space, especially on rectangular displays. It is often more efficient than facet_grid() for displaying a variable across multiple categories

The code below produces a 2D matrix of '*MATHS*' histograms grouped by variable '*CLASS*' using `facet_wrap(~CLASS)`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20) +
    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)
```

#### 1.9.2 Working with [facet_grid()]{style="color:#6A5ACD;font-weight:bold;"}

[facet_grid](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_grid.html) creates a matrix of panels based on two discrete variables, one for rows and the other for columns. It is most useful when both variables have all possible combinations in the data.

The code below plots a trellis plot using `facet_grid()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20) +
    facet_grid(~ CLASS)
```

### 1.10 Essential grammatical elements in ggplot2: Coordinates

The Coordinates functions map the position of objects onto the plane of the plot.

There are a number of different possible coordinate systems to use:

-   [`coord_cartesian()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_cartesian.html): the default cartesian coordinate systems, where you specify x and y values (e.g. allows you to zoom in or out).
-   [`coord_flip()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_flip.html): a cartesian system with the x and y flipped.
-   [`coord_fixed()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_fixed.html): a cartesian system with a "fixed" aspect ratio (e.g. 1.78 for a "widescreen" plot).
-   [`coord_quickmap()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_map.html): a coordinate system that approximates a good aspect ratio for maps.

#### 1.10.1 Working with Coordinate

By default the bar charts in ggplot2 are vertical, as shown:

```{r}
#| echo= FALSE
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x=RACE)) +
  geom_bar()
```

Using `coord_flip()`, we can flip the vertical bar chart to a horizontal one.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x=RACE)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()
```

#### 1.10.2 Changing the x and y axis range

The scatterplot below is misleading as the x and y axes are not equal. This can create confusion to the readers.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5)
```

The code below will set both the x and y axis range to 0-100.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              size=0.5) +  
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100))
```

### 1.11 Essential grammatical elements in ggplot2: Themes

Themes control elements of the graph which are not related to the data such as

-   background color

-   fonts size

-   gridlines

-   labels color

Some of the Built-in themes include:

-   `theme_gray()`: default theme, with a light gray background and white gridlines.

-   `theme_bw()`: theme with a black-and-white color scheme - white background, black gridlines and axis lines

-   `theme_classic()`: theme with a minimalist look - white background and no gridlines

The list of all other themes available can be found at this [link](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html)

#### 1.11.1 Working with Themes

The code below plot a horizontal bar chart using `theme_gray()`

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x=RACE)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_gray()
```

The code below plot a horizontal bar chart using `theme_bw()`

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x=RACE)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()
```

The code below plot a horizontal bar chart using `theme_classic()`

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x=RACE)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic()
```

We can further customize the chart by additional arguments using `theme()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x=RACE)) +
  geom_bar(fill="skyblue", color="black", size=0.7) +  
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
   theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightgrey",
                                         color = "white"))
```

#### 1.13.1 Further exploration

**1. Is it possible to add mean, median and a title on histogram?**

Before:

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="black", 
                 fill="#4169e1") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```

After:

-   `geom_vline()`: adds vertical lines for mean and median

-   `labs()`: used to set the title and add a label for the legend

-   `scale_color_manual()`: set the colors for mean and median

```{r}
# Calculate mean and median
mean_value <- mean(exam_data$MATHS, na.rm = TRUE)
median_value <- median(exam_data$MATHS, na.rm = TRUE)

# Create a data frame for the mean and median lines
line_data <- data.frame(
  value = c(mean_value, median_value),
  type = factor(c("Mean", "Median"))
)

# Create the histogram with mean and median lines and a legend
ggplot(data = exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, 
                 boundary = 100, 
                 color = "black", 
                 fill = "#4169e1") +
  geom_vline(data = line_data, aes(xintercept = value, color = type), 
             linetype = "dashed", 
             size = 1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Mean" = "red", "Median" = "green")) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Maths Scores",
       x = "Maths Scores",
       y = "Frequency",
       color = "Statistics") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**2. Exploring other useful combinations of geometric objects in ggplot2?**

-   Box plot with jittered points (`geom_boxplot()`+ `geom_jitter()`)

-   **Use case:** To see the spread of ENGLISH scores across Gender, and identify any outliers.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x=GENDER, y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill="lightblue") +   # Box plot for distribution
  geom_jitter(width=0.1, size=1, alpha=0.7)  # Jittered points for individual data

```

**Conclusion:**

-   Female students tend to have a slightly higher median English score compared to male students.

-   Male students exhibit greater variability in their English scores, with a wider range of scores observed compared to female students.
