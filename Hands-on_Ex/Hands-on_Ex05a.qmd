## 5. Creating Ternary Plot with R

### 5.1 Overview

Ternary plots visualize three-part compositional data, such as population age groups or soil composition. Displayed as a triangle with sides scaled from 0 to 1, each side represents a component. Points are plotted based on their proportions, with perpendicular lines indicating their values.

This hands-on exercise teaches you how to create a ternary plot in R to visualize and analyze Singaporeâ€™s population structure. The steps include:

Installing and loading tidyverse and ggtern packages.
Using mutate() from dplyr to derive three new measures.
Creating a static ternary plot with ggtern().
Building an interactive ternary plot using plot_ly() from Plotly.

### 5.2 Installing and launching R packages
