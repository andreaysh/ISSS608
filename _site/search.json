It is also part of the tidyverse family specially designed for visual exploration and communication.\nFor more information, visit ggplot2\n\n1.3.1 R Graphics VS ggplot\nLets compare how R Graphics, the core graphical functions of Base R and ggplot plot a simple histogram.\n\nR Graphicsggplot2\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhist(exam_data$MATHS,col = \"#4169e1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=10, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"#4169e1\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\n\nWhile R Graphics offers simpler syntax, Hadley Wickham emphasizes that the true value of ggplot2 lies not in its specific plotting syntax, but in the transformative way it approaches visualization. It enables users to think of visualizations as a method of mapping variables to the visual attributes of geometric objects, creating a powerful framework for understanding and perceiving data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Grammar of Graphics\nThe Grammar of Graphics, introduced by Leland Wilkinson in 1999, provides a structured approach to creating meaningful data visualizations. It breaks graphs into semantic components like scales and layers, offering a framework to answer the question: What is a statistical graphic?\nThe key principles I’ve learned are:\n\nGraphics are built from distinct layers of grammatical elements.\nMeaningful plots are achieved through aesthetic mapping.\n\nThis grammar helps me see how complex graphics are composed, uncover connections between seemingly different visuals, and understand the foundation of diverse visualizations. It also guides me toward recognizing well-formed, meaningful graphics while acknowledging that not all grammatically correct visuals will make sense.\n\n1.4.1 A layered grammar of graphics\nFigure shows the seven grammars of ggplot2: A layered grammar of graphics\n\n\n\nA layered grammar of graphics\n\n\nThe building blocks of the Grammar of Graphics are:\n\nData: The dataset being visualized.\nAesthetics: Attributes like position, color, size, shape, or transparency that map data to visual elements.\nGeometries: Visual elements representing data, such as points, bars, or lines.\nFacets: Subsets of data used to create multiple variations of a graph (e.g., panels).\nStatistics: Transformations summarizing data, such as means or confidence intervals.\nCoordinate Systems: The plane where data is plotted (e.g., Cartesian or polar).\nThemes: Non-data components like titles, axis labels, or legend formatting.\n\n\n\n\n1.5 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: data\nLet us call the ggplot( ) function using the code chunk below.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nA blank canvas is created with ggplot().\nggplot() initializes a ggplot object.\nThe data argument specifies the dataset for plotting.\nIf the dataset is not already a data.frame, it will be converted to one by fortify().\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: aesthetic mappings\nAesthetic mappings link data attributes to visual characteristics like position, color, size, shape, or transparency, allowing each characteristic to represent information. These mappings are defined using the aes() function, and each geom layer can have its own aes() specification.\nThe code below adds the aesthetic element into the plot.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(x=MATHS,\n           y=ENGLISH))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nggplot includes the x/y axis and the axis’s label\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: geom\nGeometric objects are the visual marks on a plot. A layer combines data, aesthetic mappings, a geometric object (geom), statistical transformations (stat), and position adjustments. Layers are typically created using geom_ functions, with options to override default stat or position settings. Every plot requires at least one geom, and additional geoms can be added using the + operator.\nRefer here for a more comprehensive list.\nBelow are some examples of geom_:\n\ngeom_point: for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line: for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)\ngeom_col: for drawing bars with heights mapped to values in the data (e.g., bar charts).\ngeom_boxplot: for drawing box-and-whisker plots to visualize data distribution and outliers.\ngeom_histogram: for drawing binned values to represent the distribution of a numeric variable (e.g., histograms).\ngeom_density: for drawing smoothed density estimates to visualize the distribution of a numeric variable.\n\n\n\n1.7.1 Geometric objects: geom_bar\nThe code below plots a bar chart by using geom_bar().\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.2 Geometric objects: geom_dotplot\nIn a dot plot, the dot width represents the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning method), and dots are stacked, with each dot signifying one observation.\nThe code below plots a dot plot chart by using geom_dotplot().\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTo note that the y scale is not very useful, and can be misleading in this case.\n\n\nTo enhance the dotplot visualization, the below (non exhaustive) are some arguments that has been added:\n\nscale_y_continuous()- to turn off the y-axis by setting it to NULL\nbinwidth - specifies the width of the bins or interval used to group the data to - 3.0\ndotsize - adjusts the size of the dots in the plot to - 0.8\nfill - specifies the fill color of the dots to - red\ncolor - specifies the outline color of the dots to - yellow\nalpha - specifies the transparency level of the dots to - 0.5\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=3.0,         \n               dotsize = 0.8,\n               fill=\"#E15841\",\n               color=\"#E1B941\",\n               alpha=0.5 ) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.3 Geometric objects: geom_histogram\ngeom_histogram()in ggplot creates a bar plot that displays the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing the data into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin.\nThe code below plots a simple histogram by using values in MATHS field of exam_data.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe default number of bins is 30, however one can always adjust the number of bins manually by using the bins() argument.\n\n\n\n\n1.7.4 Modifying a geometric object by changing geom()\nTo enhance the histogram visualization, the below (non exhaustive) are some arguments that has been added:\n\nbins - to change the number of bins to - 20\nfill - specifies the fill color of the histogram to - red\ncolor - specifies the outline color of the histogram to - green\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20,            \n                 color=\"#A8E141\",      \n                 fill=\"#E15841\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.5 Modifying a geometric object by changing aes()\nThe code below changes the interior colour of the histogram (i.e. fill) by using a sub-group of aes().\nIn this case, the fill is based on GENDER.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"grey30\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also specify the color of the fill based on GENDER.\nIn this case, we used the scale_fill_manual() function to assign specific colors to each gender.

This approach is an alternative to using aesthetics (such as color or shape) for displaying additional variables. There are two main types of faceting in ggplot2:\n\nfacet_wrap() : wraps multiple plots into a single panel, typically based on a single categorical variable. It will automatically arranges the plots into a grid.\nfacet_grid() : organizes plots into a grid based on the values of two categorical variables, one for rows and the other for columns.\n\n\n1.9.1 Working with facet_wrap()\nfacet_wrap arranges a 1D sequence of panels into a 2D layout, making better use of screen space, especially on rectangular displays. It is often more efficient than facet_grid() for displaying a variable across multiple categories\nThe code below produces a 2D matrix of ‘MATHS’ histograms grouped by variable ‘CLASS’ using facet_wrap(~CLASS).\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.9.2 Working with facet_grid()\nfacet_grid creates a matrix of panels based on two discrete variables, one for rows and the other for columns. It is most useful when both variables have all possible combinations in the data.\nThe code below plots a trellis plot using facet_grid().\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_grid(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.10 Essential grammatical elements in ggplot2: Coordinates\nThe Coordinates functions map the position of objects onto the plane of the plot.\nThere are a number of different possible coordinate systems to use:\n\ncoord_cartesian(): the default cartesian coordinate systems, where you specify x and y values (e.g. allows you to zoom in or out).\ncoord_flip(): a cartesian system with the x and y flipped.\ncoord_fixed(): a cartesian system with a “fixed” aspect ratio (e.g. 1.78 for a “widescreen” plot).\ncoord_quickmap(): a coordinate system that approximates a good aspect ratio for maps.\n\n\n1.10.1 Working with Coordinate\nBy default the bar charts in ggplot2 are vertical, as shown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing coord_flip(), we can flip the vertical bar chart to a horizontal one.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.10.2 Changing the x and y axis range\nThe scatterplot below is misleading as the x and y axes are not equal. This can create confusion to the readers.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code below will set both the x and y axis range to 0-100.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.11 Essential grammatical elements in ggplot2: Themes\nThemes control elements of the graph which are not related to the data such as\n\nbackground color\nfonts size\ngridlines\nlabels color\n\nSome of the Built-in themes include:\n\ntheme_gray(): default theme, with a light gray background and white gridlines.\ntheme_bw(): theme with a black-and-white color scheme - white background, black gridlines and axis lines\ntheme_classic(): theme with a minimalist look - white background and no gridlines\n\nThe list of all other themes available can be found at this link\n\n1.11.1 Working with Themes\nThe code below plot a horizontal bar chart using theme_gray()\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_gray()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code below plot a horizontal bar chart using theme_bw()\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code below plot a horizontal bar chart using theme_classic()\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can further customize the chart by additional arguments using theme().\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar(fill=\"skyblue\", color=\"black\", size=0.7) +  \n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"lightgrey\",\n                                         color = \"white\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.12 References\n\nKam, T.S.

Consider increasing max.overlaps\nthe warning message means that geom_label_repeal function was unable to place labels for 321 data points because they are too close to each other.\n\nResponse:\n\nOption 1: Increase max.overlaps\nOption 2: Label only specific points which involves creating a new column that marks points to label and passing the column into aes(label = ..)\nOption 3: Potentially to reduce the point size or transparency with geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Further exploration with ggrepel\nLeveraging on Hands-on_Ex01, we added the below attributes:\n\ngeom_point:customize the color = “darkblue” and changed the size = 0.5, with a solid circle shape where shape = 16.\ngeom_smooth:changed the regression line, color = “red”, made thicker size = 1, and to display as a dashed line, linetype = “dashed”.\nRefer here for the different ggplot2 point shapes.\nRefer here for the different ggplot2 line types.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  # Scatter plot with customized point appearance\n  geom_point(color = \"darkblue\", size = 0.5, shape = 16) +  # change point color, size, and shape\n  \n  # Linear regression line with customized color and line type\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=1, \n              color=\"red\",    # line color\n              linetype=\"dashed\") +  # line style\n  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ID), \n                   fontface = \"bold\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Beyond ggplot2 themes\nThere are 8 different built-in themes within ggplot2. They are:\n\ntheme_gray():default theme in ggplot2, with a gray background with white grid lines for readability.\ntheme_bw(): clean, minimalistic theme with a white background and black grid lines.\ntheme_classic():simple theme with a white background and no grid lines.\ntheme_dark():theme with a dark background and light-colored text and grid lines.\ntheme_light():light background theme with light-colored grid lines.\ntheme_linedraw():theme that uses black lines on a white background.\ntheme_minimal():minimalist theme that reduces non-data elements.\ntheme_void():clean theme with no background, grid lines, or axes.\n\n\ntheme_gray()theme_bw()theme_classic()theme_dark()theme_light()theme_linedraw()theme_minimal()theme_void()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n

    "text": "3. Programming Interactive Data Visualisation with R\n\n3.1 Learning outcome\nIn this exercise, we will be exploring how to create interactive data visualizations using the ggiraph and plotlyr packages.\n\n\n3.2 Getting started\nWe will check, install, and load the following R packages, if not already done so:\n\ngiraph: Adds interactivity to ggplot graphics.\nplotly: Enables interactive statistical plotting.\nDT: Provides an interface to the JavaScript library DataTables for interactive HTML tables.\ntidyverse: A collection of R packages for data science, including static graph creation.\npatchwork:Combines multiple ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\n\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, \n               patchwork, DT, tidyverse) \n\n\n\n\n3.3 Importing data\nIn this section, we will use the read_csv() function from the readr package to import the Exam_data.csv file into R. The file will be loaded as a tibble data frame and saved as exam_data.\n\n\nCode\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThis section data is the same dataset used in Hands-on_Ex01 and Hands-on_Ex02\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Interactive data visualisation - ggiraph\nggiraph is an HTML widget and an extension of ggplot2, enabling interactive ggplot graphics. Interactivity is achieved using three key arguments:\n\nTooltip: Displays information when hovering over elements.\nOnclick: Executes a JavaScript function when elements are clicked.\nData_id: Associates elements with unique IDs for further interaction.\n\nIn Shiny applications, elements with data_id can be selected and manipulated on both the client and server sides. For more details, refer here.\n\n3.4.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic\nThe code shows how to create an interactive statistical graph using the ggiraph package.\nIt consists of two steps:\n\nFirst, a ggplot object is created, and\nSecond, the girafe() function of ggiraph is used to convert it into an interactive SVG object.\n\n\n\nCode\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUnderstand the 2 steps\n\n1.

Unlike other Plotly platforms, plotly for R is free and open-source, built on the MIT-licensed plotly.js JavaScript library.\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly:\n\nplot_ly():A function in Plotly’s R library for building interactive visualizations from scratch.\nggplotly():A function that converts static ggplot2 visualizations into interactive Plotly graphics.\n\n\n3.7.1 Creating an interactive scatter plot: plot_ly() method\n\nPlot()Code()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Working with visual variable: plot_ly() method\nThe color argument is added to a qualitative visual variable (e.g.: RACE)\n\nPlot()Code()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~ENGLISH, \n        y = ~MATHS, \n        color = ~RACE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Creating an interactive scatter plot: ggplotly() method\nThe code plots an interactive scatter plot by using ggplotly().\n\nPlot()Code()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nggplotly(p)\n\n\nThe only additional line required in the code chunk is ggplotly().\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.4 Coordinated multiple views with plotly\nCreating a coordinated linked plot with plotly involves three key steps:\n\nShare Data: Use highlight_key]() from the Plotly package to create shared data.\nCreate Scatterplots: Generate two scatterplots using the ggplot2 functions.\nCombine Plots: Use subplot() from the Plotly package to arrange the plots side by side.\n\n\nPlot()Code()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nClick on a data point of one of the scatterplot and see how the corresponding point on the other scatterplot is selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nhighlight_key() creates an object of class crosstalk::SharedData\nVisit this link to learn more about crosstalk.\ncrosstalk::SharedData is a function provided by the Crosstalk package in R, which enables shared interactivity between multiple visualizations or widgets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8 Interactive data visualization - crosstalk methods!\nCrosstalk is an extension for the htmlwidgets package that provides classes, functions, and conventions to enable cross-widget interactions, such as linked brushing and filtering.\n\n3.8.1 Interactive data table: DT package\n\nDataTables is a wrapper for the JavaScript library DataTables, allowing R data objects to be displayed as interactive HTML tables.\nIt is commonly used in R Markdown or Shiny applications.\n\n\n\nCode\nDT::datatable(exam_data, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.2 Linked brushing: crosstalk method\n\nPlot()Code()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode below is used to implement the coordinated brushing shown:\n\n\nCode\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data) \np &lt;- ggplot(d, \n            aes(ENGLISH, \n                MATHS)) + \n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg &lt;- highlight(ggplotly(p),        \n                \"plotly_selected\")  \n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,               \n                  DT::datatable(d), \n                  widths = 5)        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThings to learn: - [*highlight()]*(https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/plotly/versions/4.10.4/topics/highlight) is a function of plotly package. It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\n\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

    "text": "3b. Programming animated statistical graphics with R\n\n3.1 Overview\nIn this Hands-on exercise 03b, we will learn how to create engaging animated data visualizations using the gganimate and plotly R packages. We will also learn how to reshape data with the tidyr package and process, wrangle, and transform data with the dplyr package.\nOverall, animated graphics not only captivate the audience but also leave a lasting impression, making them an effective tool for visually-driven data storytelling.\n\n3.1.1 Basic concepts of animation\nAnimations in data visualization are created by generating a series of individual plots, each representing a subset of the data. These plots are then stitched together into sequential frames to create the illusion of motion, similar to a flipbook or traditional cartoons. The animated effect is driven by the transitions between data subsets over time.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Terminology\nBefore creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand key concepts:\n\nFrame: each frame represents a specific point in time or category, updating the graph’s data points as it changes.\nAnimation attributes: control the animation’s behavior, such as frame duration, easing functions for transitions, and whether the animation starts from the current frame or resets to the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo read\n\n\n\nConsider whether the effort is justified before creating animated graphs. For exploratory data analysis, animations may not be worth the time. However, in presentations, well-placed animations can significantly enhance audience engagement compared to static visuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Getting started\n\n3.2.1 Loading the R packages\nFirst, we install and load the folliwing R packages:\n\nplotly: An R library for creating interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate: A ggplot2 extension for making animated graphs\ngifski: A tool for converting video frames into high-quality animated GIFs using advanced palette and dithering techniques.\ngapminder: A dataset excerpt from Gapminder.org, often used for its country_colors schemes.\ntidyverse: A collection of modern R packages designed for data science tasks, including analysis, communication, and creating static graphs.\n\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,\n               plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Importing the data\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.\nImporting Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nread_xls(): Imports Excel worksheets, readxl package\nmutate_each_():Converts all character data types to factors, dplyr package\nmutate(): Converts the Year field values to integers, dplyr package\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\nWarning: mutate_each_() was deprecated in dplyr 0.7.0.\nWarning: funs() was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0.\n\n\n\nWe will re-write the code by using mutate_at() as shown below.\n’mutate(across())` can be used to derive the same outputs.\n\nmutate_at()mutate(across())\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(col, as.factor) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(col, as.factor)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Inspecting the data\n\n\nCode\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\", sheet = \"Data\")\n\n\nWe will check the dataset using below\n\nglimpse(): provides a transposed overview of a dataset, showing variables and their types in a concise format.\nhead(): displays the first few rows of a dataset (default is 6 rows) to give a quick preview of the data.\nsummary(): generates a statistical summary of each variable, including measures like mean, median, and range for numeric data.\nduplicated():Returns a logical vector indicating which elements or rows in a vector or data frame are duplicates.\ncolSums(is.na()): Counts the number of missing values (NA) in each column of the data frame.\n\n\nglimpse()head()summary()duplicated()colSum(is.na(dataset))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nglimpse(globalPop)\n\n\nRows: 6,204\nColumns: 6\n$ Country    &lt;chr&gt; \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\",…\n$ Year       &lt;dbl&gt; 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014,…\n$ Young      &lt;dbl&gt; 83.6, 84.1, 84.6, 85.1, 84.5, 84.3, 84.1, 83.7, 82.9, 82.1,…\n$ Old        &lt;dbl&gt; 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.6, 4.6, 4.6, 4.6, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7,…\n$ Population &lt;dbl&gt; 21559.9, 22912.8, 23898.2, 25268.4, 28513.7, 31057.0, 32738…\n$ Continent  &lt;chr&gt; \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"As…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhead(globalPop)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  Country      Year Young   Old Population Continent\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 Afghanistan  1996  83.6   4.5     21560.

The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Animated data visualisation: plotly\nIn the Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() enable keyframe animations using the frame argument or aesthetic. Additionally, they support the ids argument or aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions for objects with the same ID, promoting object constancy during animations.\n\n3.4.1 Building an animated bubble plot: ggplotly() method\n\nPlot()Code()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe animated bubble plot will includes a play/pause button and a slider component for controlling the animation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nA static bubble plot is created using ggplot2 functions and saved as an R object named gg.\nThe ggplotly() function is then used to convert this static plot into an animated SVG object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\nYou will notice that the show.legend = FALSE argument was used, but the legend still appears on the plot.

    "text": "4. Visualising Distribution\n\n4.1 Learning outcome\nVisualizing distributions is a fundamental aspect of statistical analysis. In Chapter 1, we introduced common methods such as histograms, probability density curves (PDFs), boxplots, notch plots, and violin plots using ggplot2.\nIn this chapter, we explore two newer techniques\n\nridgeline plots: display multiple density plots stacked vertically to compare distributions across groups,\nraincloud plots: combine a density plot, boxplot, and scatter plot to provide a comprehensive view of data\n\nby utilizing ggplot2 and its extensions.\n\n\n4.2 Getting started\n\n4.2.1 Installing and loading the packages\nThe following R packages will be used,\n\nggridges:ggplot2 extension for creating ridgeline plots.\nggdist:ggplot2 extension for visualizing distribution and uncertainty.\ntidyverse:collection of R packages designed for modern data science and visual communication.\nggthemes:ggplot2 extension offering additional themes, scales, and geoms for enhanced visualizations.\ncolorspace:R package for selecting, manipulating, and applying color palettes in visualizations.\n\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes,\n               colorspace, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Importing data\nIn this exercise, Exam_data.csv will be used. The `read_csv() function from the readr package is used to import the dataset into R and store it as a tibble data frame.\n\n\nCode\nexam &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThis section data is the same dataset used in Hands-on_Ex01, Hands-on_Ex02 Hands-on_Ex03a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Visualising distribution with ridgeline plot\nA ridgeline plot (also known as a Joyplot) visualizes the distribution of a numeric variable across multiple groups. It uses overlapping histograms or density plots aligned on the same horizontal scale.\nThe figure below illustrates the distribution of English scores by class using a ridgeline plot.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"pink\", .3),\n    color = \"blue\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"ENGLISH\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = \"CLASS\", expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen to use a ridgeline plot\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots are ideal for visualizing medium to large groups, as overlapping distributions help conserve space compared to separate plots. However, for fewer than five groups, other distribution plots may be more effective.\nThey work best when there is a clear pattern or ranking among groups; otherwise, excessive overlap can make the plot cluttered and less informative.\n\n\n\n\n4.3.1 Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nIn R, ridgeline plots can be created using the ggridges package, which provides two key functions:\n\ngeom_ridgeline(): Uses direct height values to draw ridgelines.\ngeom_density_ridges(): Estimates data densities before plotting ridgelines.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a ridgeline plot created with geom_density_ridges().\n\nPlot()Code()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"white\", .3),\n    color = \"#7097BB\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\nTo add gradient fills to ridgeline plots, use geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(), which function similarly to their non-gradient counterparts - geom_ridgeline(), and geom_density_ridges() but allow varying colors along the x-axis.\nHowever, they do not support alpha transparency—only color variation or transparency can be applied, but not both.\n\nPlot()Code()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

It improves traditional boxplots by revealing multiple modes in the data, indicating potential group structures. Unlike boxplots, raincloud plots show where densities are clustered.\nIn this section, we will be learning how to create a raincloud plot to visualize English scores by race using functions from the ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n4.4.1 Plotting a half eye graph\nFirst, by using stat_halfeye() from the ggdist package to create a Half-Eye plot, which combines a half-density plot with a slab-interval for visualizing distributions.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nGraphCode()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Adding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, the code will add a narrow boxplot using geom_boxplot() from ggplot2, reducing its width and adjusting opacity for better visualization.\n\nGraphCode()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Adding the dot plots with stat_dots()\nNext, we’ll use stat_dots() from ggdist to add a half-dot plot, similar to a histogram, showing sample counts with dots.\nSetting side = “left” positions it on the left-hand side.\n\nGraphCode()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.4 Finishing touch\nLastly, coord_flip() from ggplot2 flips the chart horizontally, creating the raincloud effect, while theme_economist() from ggthemes enhances its appearance.\n\nGraphCode()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Reference\n\nIntroducing Ridgeline Plots (formerly Joyplots)\nClaus O.

Visualising Statistical Analysis\n\n4.1 Learning outcome\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will be exploring:\n\nggstatsplot for creating statistical visualizations,\nperformance for visualizing model diagnostics, and\nparameters for visualizing model parameters.\n\n\n\n4.2 Visual Statistical Analysis with ggstatsplot\nggstatsplot extends ggplot2, integrating statistical test results directly into visualizations.\n\nOffers alternative statistical inference methods by default.\nEnsures best practices for statistical reporting, following APA standards for consistency.\nExample: Displays results from a robust t-test within the plot.\n\n\n\n4.3 Getting Started\n\n4.3.1 Installing and loading the packages\nWe will be using ggstatsplot and tidyverse packags.\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(ggstatsplot, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Importing data\nIn this exercise, Exam_data.csv will be used. The `read_csv() function from the readr package is used to import the dataset into R and store it as a tibble data frame.\n\n\nCode\nexam &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nstat(exam)\n\n\n# A tibble: 322 × 7\n   ID         CLASS GENDER RACE    ENGLISH MATHS SCIENCE\n   &lt;chr&gt;
