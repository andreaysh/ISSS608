<section id="overview" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">5.1 Overview</h3>
<p>Parallel coordinates plots, invented by <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~aiisreal/">Alfred Inselberg</a> in the 1970s, are a visualization technique designed for analyzing multivariate numerical data. They help in comparing multiple variables and identifying relationships, commonly used in academic and scientific fields rather than business settings. As noted by <a href="https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/b-eye/parallel_coordinates.pdf">Stephen Few</a> (2006), their strength lies in interactive analysis rather than public presentation. A key application includes characterizing clusters in customer segmentation.</p>
<p>By the end of this hands-on exercise, we will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plot static parallel coordinates plots using <code>ggparcoord()</code> from the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/GGally/versions/2.2.1"><strong>GGally</strong></a> package.</li>
<li>Create interactive parallel coordinates plots with the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/MASS/versions/7.3-64/topics/parcoord"><strong>parcoords</strong></a> package.</li>
<li>Generate interactive parallel coordinates plots using the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/parallelPlot/versions/0.4.0"><strong>parallelPlot</strong></a> package.</li>
